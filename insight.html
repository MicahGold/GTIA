    <h2>Key Negotiation Insights</h2>
    
    <div class="insight-box">
        <h3>Insight #1: Align Internal Interests Before External Negotiations</h3>
        <p><strong>Although in many classroom partner negotiations it's assumed that team members share identical interests, real-world scenarios involve varying incentives even among co-workers and couples. Effective negotiators should shore up their position with their negotiation partner before engaging with the opposing side.</strong></p>
        
        <h4>Rationale:</h4>
        <p>If Steph were to begin negotiating with Intellicorp without consulting Geoff first, she risks reaching a settlement that satisfies her expectations but fails to meet Geoff's needs. This misalignment could cause Geoff to pursue litigation anyway and Steph to miss out on expected value. Attempting to negotiate simultaneously with both Geoff and Intellicorp is diffcult (simultaneous interdependent negotiations are exceedingly complex to manage). By isolating and resolving the negotiation with Geoff first, Steph effectively neutralizes the threat posed by their misaligned incentives and creates a more unified front for the external negotiation.</p>

    <div class="insight-box">
        <h3>Insight #2: Credentials Create Leverage in First-Time Negotiations</h3>
        <p><strong>Professional credentials can help parties establish leverage in a negotiation â€“ particularly when engaging with another party for the first time.</strong></p>
        
        <h4>Rationale:</h4>
        <p>Intellicorp will likely be influenced by Geoff and Steph's law degrees. Robert Cialdini might characterize this as the influence of social proof.  While all wronged parties retain the right to sue a company or secure legal representation, Geoff and Steph are lawyers themselves and so confrontation with them oddly is more socially feared (this might be because being lawyers makes their willingness to litigate appear more credible and immediate, but social proof has much to do with it).  
            Their perceived expertise functions as implicit leverage that can influence Intellicorp's approach to the negotiation and potentially their settlement offers.</p>
