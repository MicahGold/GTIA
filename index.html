        <h2>Case Introduction</h2>
        <p>As Geoff Gold awoke one morning from uneasy dreams, he found his right arm transformed into a numb tingling noodle. It was already 8:00 and the sun was high over the Getty Museum; he had to be downtown by 8:30. Cursing his new iPhone 16 and its arcane Clock app – which was surely different from his iPhone 14’s Clock app — he stumbled into the bathroom.</p>
        <p>He cut both his chins while shaving, and could hardly open the toilet bowl without straining his spine; but he hardly seemed to notice. That night, in what he believed to be a departure from his normal inclinations, he agnegated his dish duty to his son who also noticed little out of the ordinary.</p>
        <p>Over the next six months, Geoff’s arm atrophied. Despite a healthy diet, a vigorous exercise regimen, uncountable hours Googling “best remedies for arm pain” and a few more texting his son's random treatments he found, the deterioration persisted.</p>
        <p>On advice from a colleague, he took up personal training. Although it left him satisfied with his diligence and equipped with a burgeoning appreciation of anatomical nomenclature (he found himself murmuring mellifluous phrases like “glenoid fossa” with reverent zeal) Geoff’s arm continued to shrivel.</p>
        <p>Unsatisfied with the explanations of surgeons much too willing to cut-first and ask questions later, Geoff decided to do what he is best at. Nothing. But the pain persisted. And so began his racoonish nightly rummagings through the medicine cabinet for aged pills synthesized back when the Sacklers were hucking ether in Galicia.</p>
        <p>After multiple expired valium and ensuing remonstrations from his wife Stephanie, Geoff acceded to consult a specialist up North. When he arrived in San Francisco, Waymo saved him the pain of hailing a cab. As he sat in the Electric Jaguar, his mind drifted to the Tesla CEO. Musks’ nimble gesture replayed in his head, inaugurating disgust and envy. He inhaled, frowned, and stertorously muttered “symphysis” as if casting a spell.</p>
        <p>The specialist was a bearer of bad news. Geoff had a rare neurological disease. Geoff had a PPO plan. The doctor recommended a preferred provider in San Francisco. When he arrived at Intellicorp, they ushered him into an expensive new MRI machine.</p>
        <p>Last month, Geoff and Steph were shocked to learn they had been billed $22,000. Luckily, like 92% of Americans Steph and Geoff are insured. After negotiating down the cost, Blue Shield paid $10,621 leaving Geoff on the hook for a $500 deductible and a $2,805 co-pay.</p>
        <p>$22,000 seemed ludicrous and $10,621 not much better. Steph called Intellicorp and learned that an uninsured patient could expect to pay only $7,000.</p>
        <p>Geoff was enraged. He was being swindled. He had decided Intellicorp should remit the cost of the co-pay. He would not pay.</p>

        <h2>EV Details</h2>
        <p>Geoff is an obstinate litigator. He would rather conquer than settle. Geoff is also irritable and has many nose hairs.</p>
        <p>Geoff wants to litigate on his own behalf. But spending his hours in small claims court means missing out on extracting value from – or “helping” – his clients. Geoff estimates that the opportunity cost of litigating is <strong>-$1,500</strong>. However, should the case go to trial, he believes that there is a <strong>70%</strong> chance he does not have to pay Intellicorp a dime. He finds the prospect of a lawsuit invigorating and paying Intellicorp emasculating. If he pays Intellicorp outright, he fears he would have to go to therapy to heal his fragile id and subsequently pay another copay of <strong>-$200</strong>.</p>
        <p>The longer Geoff contests the charges, the greater the sum he may have to pay: Intellicorp is assessing late fees of <strong>2%</strong> on the amount initially billed to Blue Shield each week. Geoff calculates that even if the case goes to trial, the entire affair will be completed within <strong>10 weeks</strong>.</p>
        <p>Steph is no stranger to litigation. She too is an attorney. But she retired from full-time practice decades ago. Today, Steph works the most underappreciated job in America. She is a landlord. She also works the most appreciated job in America. She is Geoff’s wife.</p>
        <p>Steph does not want delinquent payments to compromise Geoff’s healthcare. There are very few providers in the country that have access to these new MRI machines. The closest one (aside from Intellicorp) is located in Bloomington, Indiana, home of the Hoosiers and continental capital of PCB pollution. She estimates the cost of going to the Indiana clinic for subsequent scans to be <strong>-$2,350</strong> per scan (in part due to elevated travel expenses).</p>
        <p>California is a community property state and Steph and Geoff share almost all of their assets. They are both progressive Democrats, staunch luddites, and loyal subscribers to <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine. However, each maintains a secret strategic reserve of Trumpcoin for personal expenses.</p>
        <p>Steph wants to visit her son in New Haven, who has only ever had complimentary things to write about his parents in his serious university assignments. Should the case go to trial she will have to cancel her non-refundable JetBlue ticket and hotel stay. She will also have to forfeit a coveted reservation at Maison Merde, the only East Coast restaurant that serves probiotic foie gras carpaccio in its original casing. In total, Steph will be out <strong>-$2,700</strong> Trumpcoin.</p> 
        <p>Geoff is bullish on Trumpcoin and regardless cannot figure out how to sell it. When he can’t sleep at night, he rolls over onto his good side and surreptitiously checks his porch camera for an envelope inviting him to dine with Bill Maher, Larry David, and Joseph Goebbels.</p>
        <p>Intellicorp pays for business litigation insurance offered by the backwards Icelandic firm Laus Namdoog and Associates. Laus Namdoog usually only charges a <strong>-$250</strong> copay. Unfortunately, Intellicorp is <strong>-$800</strong> short of their deductible for the year. Fortunately, Laus has never lost a case. Even against Geoff Gold, they reckon they have a <strong>90%</strong> chance of victory.</p>
        <p>Intellicorp knows that most patients with Geoff’s condition require <strong>3 MRI scans</strong> over the course of their treatment. They believe that whatever Geoff pays for this initial payment will set the price for future service. As such, they model the value of Geoff’s initial payment as <strong>3×</strong> its face value. They also know that if they end up in a lawsuit with Geoff, he is unlikely to return to their clinic.</p>
        <p>Intellicorp’s payment department is operated by power-duo: Aesculapius and his supervisor Heath Crair. Intellicorp retains the first <strong>$7,000</strong> (after litigation expenses). Heath Crair and Aesculapius split every dollar after this threshold <strong>50–50</strong>. Aesculapius mans the phone line while Heath plays Wordle on his computer.</p>
        <p>Heath Crair is the only employee authorized to adjust issued bills, but Heath hates paperwork and detests talking to patients. If Aesculapius gets the clients to pay the initial bill, Heath has agreed to give him an additional <strong>10%</strong> on every dollar.</p>
